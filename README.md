# CloudCannon Bookshop Component Workflow with Hugo
Presented by: David, Renzo

## Pitch
We want a component-driven development workflow that integrates with Hugo while allowing easy self-service changes for content writing teams. Could CloudCannonâ€™s Bookshop library and UI be the solution?

## Result
A [landing page was created](https://charming-tuba.cloudvent.net/) that a user could easily go into the CloudCannon app and make content changes on the fly with immediate, visual feedback. [See this quick demo here](https://a.cl.ly/p9uLd989). Changes in the UI create a commit that automatically updates the markdown file with the edits made.

### Notes
This was built in a day using a brand new Hugo site from scratch with a "homemade" template. Technolgies are: Hugo, Tailwind, CloudCannon Bookshop.

This provides a great UI for content writers to edit content and to see their changes, while simultaneously updating possibly complicated markdown files. However, this still feels a bit locked-in to the context of Hugo and Hugo's specific templating environment. We should still visit the idea of native components that are template agnostic.

### Resources
[CloudCannon Bookshop Repo](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop) and their [Hugo Reference Guide](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/blob/main/guides/hugo.adoc) used to build this project.
