      Datadog is committed to developing a dialogue of transparency and
      accountability in the ways we conduct business.

      <br/><br/>

      The 2021 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report is Datadog's
      inaugural sustainability report. We address ESG topics where we seek
      greater engagement with our investors, employees, customers, vendors, and
      other stakeholders. Datadog is proud of the progress we have made, and we
      look forward to updating you as we further integrate sustainability into
      our operations.
