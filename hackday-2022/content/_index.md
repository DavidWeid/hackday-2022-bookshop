      accountability in the ways we conduct business.

      <br/><br/>

      The 2021 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report is Datadog's
      inaugural sustainability report. We address ESG topics where we seek
      greater engagement with our investors, employees, customers, vendors, and
      other stakeholders. Datadog is proud of the progress we have made, and we
      look forward to updating you as we further integrate sustainability into
      our operations.

      ESG is a key priority at Datadog, with direct oversight from the board of
      directors and management. Our board is composed of 50 percent
      racially/ethnically diverse members. Collectively, they possess the
      professional and industry knowledge, financial expertise, and high-level
      management experience that is necessary to oversee our business. We are
      committed to the highest standard of business ethics and strive to keep
      risk management, intellectual property protection, data security, and
      privacy at the forefront of our business.

      We believe that contributing to the well-being of communities and society
      around us is the right thing to do. Together with our global employees, we
      donated over $4 million in 2021 to causes that impact our employees and
      the world around us, including Black Lives Matter, COVID-19 relief, and
      more.

      We are continually evaluating ways to scale efficiently and reduce waste
      production. Born and bred in the cloud, the Datadog platform leverages
      economies of scale regarding carbon emissions and electricity usage while
      enabling our customers to reduce their own carbon footprint. Our latest
      version of the Datadog Agent uses 60 percent less CPU than previous
      versions, which we believe results in a meaningful global impact.
